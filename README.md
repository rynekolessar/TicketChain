# TicketChain

Ticketchain is a Peer to Peer ticket sales website based on the Ethereum Blockchain. 
Our mission is to provide a way to buy and sell tickets to events without going 
through a middle-man like Ticketmaster or Stubhub and paying loads of fees.
Simply install metamask in your browser, acquire Ether (ETH), and start shopping!
